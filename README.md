PlayerUnknown's ChoosingGround - A "Chicken Dinner" by taking risks choosing strategies.

Hi, welcome to this new repository about a game called PUCG.
This game, if developed as a real game, would better function as this:
1. Gather 100 online player, put them in a "map", where they have 20 places that they can choose to go to.
2. Once chosen, they are allowed to choose guns, which may later influence the chance to survive in a fight.
3. Then it is the first round of fight.
  a. There will be 3 basically situations: Hear steps, hear gunshots, nothing.
  b. choose the way to deal with the situation: Check out, go for close fight, go for long distance fight, run away (choose a place)
  c. based on the gun used, the method choosed by each of the participant (randomly choosed), one will survive in a fight.
  d. the survivor can change their gun with the guns their enermy have.
  e. if still more than one player is in the place, repeat a-d.
  f. the last survivor (the one who chose run away will not be counted even if they survived) can choose where they would go next for the second round. a number of locations will be blocked out by the Zone.
4. Keep the same method, run again and again until there's a last survivor.
